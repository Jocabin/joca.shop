It is a prove of concept, for a fully functional and feature complete e-commerce website, written in plain PHP and HTMX.

Everything is served via Caddy web server.

The main goal is to prove to the web development ecosystem that you don't need fancy frameworks, docker containers, etc to do a complete, complex and featurefull web project.

Hope I successfully prove this point :)
