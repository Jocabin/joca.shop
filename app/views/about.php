        <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">About this site.</h1>
        <p class="leading-8">
                This site is a “proof of concept” that it's possible to make a complete, accessible, high-performance, featurefull website using simple, no-frills technologies.
                <br>
                I don't use any fancy technologies, no javascript frameworks, no docker containers or whatever.
                Just HTML, Tailwind, PHP and HTMX for a bit of interactivity.
                <br>
                All served with the Caddy web server.
        </p>

                This site features fake products from the <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/" class="link" target="_blank">Fake Store API</a>.
                <br>
                The payment system is fake, because I'm not going to sell fake products I don't have in stock.
                <br>
                All the code is open source, on my <a href="https://github.com/Jocabin/joca.shop" class="link" target="_blank">Github repo</a>.
                <br>
                Have fun exploring the site and its code, and give me feedback/requests for features.
        </p>
